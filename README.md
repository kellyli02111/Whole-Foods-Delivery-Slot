# WholeFoodsDeliverySlot

Yes, these days checking for Whole Foods delivery slots can get cumbersome. To free you off the constant hastle of checking for slots, this automated script can notify you (yes notifies you verbally, so you can go 'bout your tasks) of when new delivery slots open.

Usage:
The script works on Chrome for now. 
It initializes a Chrome webdriver, for which if you don't have one install it from: https://chromedriver.chromium.org/
You'll have to update the path of the this installed webdriver under: "driver = webdriver.Chrome()" if its not the default location your OS needs.
